### Includes Programs-

* **Program 1**
**a.** Write a LEX program to recognize valid arithmetic
expression. Identifiers in the expression could be only integers and operators could be + and *. Count the identifiers &amp; operators present and print them separately.\
**b.** Write YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators: +, -, *, and /.

* **Program 2**
Develop, Implement and execute a program using YACC tool
to recognize all strings ending with b preceded by n a’s using
the grammar a n b (note: input n value).

* **Program 3**
Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to
construct Predictive / LL(1) Parsing Table for the grammar rules: A →aBa , B →bB | ε. Use this table to parse the sentence: abba$.

* **Program 4**
Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to
demonstrate Shift Reduce Parsing technique for the grammar rules: E →E+T | T, T →T*F | F, F →(E) | id and parse the sentence: id + id * id.

* **Program 5**
Design, develop and implement a C/Java program to generate
the machine code using Triples for the statement A = -B * (C
+D) whose intermediate code in three-address form: T1 = -B
T2 = C + D T3 = T1 + T2
A = T3

* **Program 6**
**a.** Write a LEX program to eliminate comment lines in a C
program and copy the resulting program into a separate file.\
**b.** Write YACC program to recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text (C program) file.

* **Program 7**
Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to
simulate the working of Shortest remaining time and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. Experiment with different quantum sizes for RR algorithm.

* **Program 8**
Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to
implement Banker’s algorithm. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.

* **Program 9**
Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to
implement page replacement algorithms LRU and FIFO. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.
